# tictactoe
This is a command-line Tic Tac Toe game made using JavaScript with Node.js. Two players take turns placing their symbols (🐐 and 🍇) on a 3x3 board. After each move, the game checks if someone has won or if the game is a draw. It uses an array to store the board and has simple logic to handle turns, check for winners, and get user input.
